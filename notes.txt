things that should be configurable:
  - what gets returned when there's no match
  - signal for breaking out of a loop
  
  - function names...
  
...just yield the functions, k-v style, and allow the caller to decide what to do...

later: good errors for when you don't define a feature.
  checkFeatures() ?
  
think of how to do dogfood around arguments and general array handling...
  call self / lazy initializer?
  named anonymous function?
